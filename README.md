# Module 8 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

Creating a weather dashboard that uses weather API to retrieve 5 day weather data for different cities.

This dashboard is created following the following user story:
"AS A traveler I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities, SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly"

 The functions of this weather dashboard perform the following:
  * When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
  * When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
    * The city name
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
    * The wind speed
  * When a user view future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
